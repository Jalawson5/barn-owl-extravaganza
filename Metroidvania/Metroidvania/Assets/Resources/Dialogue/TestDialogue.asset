  - Hello! I am a test dialogue!
  - This dialogue should wrap to the next line. Unless it doesn't, which is bad.
    Don't do that.
  - During this fight, I've seen a lot of changing, in the way you feel about me,
    and in the way I feel about you. In here, there were two guys killing each other,
    but I guess that's better than twenty million. I guess what I'm trying to say,
    is that if I can change, and you can change, everybody can change!
