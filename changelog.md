### Changes
* Enemies using the GroundChaseMovement behavior can now jump if the target player is above them or walk off of a platform if the player is below them. These behaviors are both optional.

### Known Issues
* Player and enemy hitboxes occasionally get caught on the corners of terrain due to the shape of the hitboxes.
* Player and enemy sometimes jitter around when falling while pressing against a wall. Cause unknown.
